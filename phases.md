phase-by-phase roadmap to build your advanced agentic AI trading bot. This plan starts with the core foundation using Angel One and your data, then incrementally adds the agentic features, AI optimization, multi-broker support, and other advanced capabilities.
Phase 1: Foundational Core & Manual Backtesting (Est. 2-4 months)

Goal: Build a stable backtesting system for Angel One using your historical data. Verify basic strategy execution and result analysis manually.
Broker: Angel One
Key Features:
Market Connector (Angel One): Implement using smartapi-python. Focus on fetching/processing your historical data files (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m). Basic real-time data fetching capability (WebSocket) for later use.
Data Feed: Module to load, clean, and provide your historical data (Pandas DataFrames) to the backtester.
Strategy Library: Implement 2-3 basic, non-agentic strategies (e.g., Moving Average Crossover, RSI Mean Reversion) with fixed parameters and logic.
Backtesting Engine: Setup using VectorBT or Backtrader. Enable running selected strategies on your historical data across different timeframes. Calculate and display core metrics (P&L Curve, Total Return, Max Drawdown, Win Rate).
Risk Management (Simulated): Basic static rules within the backtester (e.g., Stop Loss = 2%, Take Profit = 4%, Fixed Quantity = 1 lot/share).
Order Execution (Simulated): Simulate trade entries/exits within the backtester based on strategy signals and risk rules.
UI (Minimal): Simple interface (Command-line or basic web UI with Streamlit/Dash) to:Load specific historical data.
Select a strategy and timeframe.
Run the backtest.
View the P&L curve and a table of performance metrics.
Infrastructure: Setup Python environment, version control (Git), basic logging.
Outcome: A functional backtesting system for Angel One where you can test simple strategies on your data and manually analyze the results.
Phase 2: Agentic Core (v1), AI Analysis & Initial Live Trading (Est. 3-5 months)

Goal: Introduce the first version of the agentic decision-making, enable AI-powered analysis of backtests using OpenAI, and facilitate basic supervised live trading on Angel One.
Broker: Angel One
Key Features:
Analysis Engine: Add calculation of more indicators (ATR, ADX, Bollinger Bands). Implement rule-based market regime detection (e.g., identify Trending vs. Ranging using ADX/MA slopes).
Agentic Core (v1 - Rule-Based): Implement the "brain" using rules:Selects which strategy (from Phase 1) to activate based on the detected market regime.
Determines dynamic parameters (e.g., SL/TP levels based on current ATR, basic position sizing based on volatility).
Backtesting Engine Enhancement: Integrate the Agentic Core to simulate dynamic strategy selection and adaptive parameters. Add more metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Profit Factor).
Strategy Optimizer Agent (v1 - Analysis):Integrate OpenAI API (requires your key).
Add an "Analyze with AI" feature to the backtesting UI.
Sends backtest results + strategy code to GPT-4 via API.
Displays the LLM's analysis and suggestions for logic improvement in the UI.
Risk Management (Live Basic): Apply dynamic SL/TP decided by the Agentic Core. Implement max daily loss limit check.
Order Execution (Live): Implement live order placement, modification (for TSL), and cancellation via smartapi-python for Angel One (start with basic order types). Secure API key management.
Portfolio Manager: Track live positions, P&L, and account balance from Angel One.
UI Enhancements: Display market regime, active strategy, dynamic parameters used. Show live P&L and positions. Integrate the OpenAI analysis results view. Add basic controls to start/stop the live agent.
Automation (Basic): Schedule agent to start/stop based on market timings. Allow uploading/managing a holiday list file.
Outcome: A bot capable of basic agentic decision-making, running live (supervised) on Angel One, with AI assistance for analyzing backtest results to guide manual strategy improvements.
Phase 3: Advanced Strategies, Multi-Broker & Optimization (Est. 4-6 months)

Goal: Enhance agent capabilities, add specialized strategies, integrate a second broker, introduce parameter optimization, and prepare for robust cloud deployment.
Brokers: Angel One + Add Dhan or Delta Exchange
Key Features:
Multi-Broker Integration: Add Market Connector, Data Feed handling, and OMS execution logic for the second chosen broker (Dhan or Delta). Refactor for seamless multi-broker operation.
Strategy Library Expansion: Add more sophisticated strategies, including logic specifically for Indian market opening volatility and expiry day ("hero-zero") trades.
Agentic Core (v2): Refine the rule-based system or explore initial ML models (e.g., simple classifier for regime detection) or basic Reinforcement Learning if performance warrants it.
Risk Management: Implement portfolio-level constraints (e.g., max capital allocation per strategy, overall portfolio drawdown limit). Add user override feature (e.g., "Stop trading for today" button).
Strategy Optimizer Agent (v2 - Parameter Tuning): Integrate traditional hyperparameter optimization libraries (e.g., Optuna) to automatically find optimal parameters for strategies, complementing the LLM's logic suggestions. Potentially explore semi-automated application of LLM code suggestions (with user confirmation).
Backtesting Engine: Add features to compare performance across different strategies, parameter sets, or market regimes. Implement manual backtest data upload via UI.
UI Improvements: Develop a more comprehensive dashboard showing multi-broker positions, detailed risk exposure, strategy performance comparison charts, enhanced trade logs (showing agent rationale).
Infrastructure: Containerize the application using Docker. Prepare for cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure). Implement more robust monitoring and alerting.
Outcome: A significantly more capable bot operating across two brokers, using more advanced strategies and risk management, with tools for both AI-assisted logic refinement and automated parameter optimization. Ready for reliable cloud deployment.
Phase 4: Polish, Performance & Expansion (Ongoing)

Goal: Optimize for performance, enhance robustness, security, and potentially add more advanced ML/AI features or brokers based on results and needs.
Brokers: Existing + potentially more
Key Features:
Performance Optimization: Identify and optimize bottlenecks, especially in data processing and decision latency if needed.
Advanced Execution: Implement smarter execution algorithms (VWAP, order slicing) if required by trade sizes or market impact.
Advanced ML/AI: Integrate more complex ML models for prediction, sentiment analysis (using dedicated feeds), or implement a more sophisticated RL agent if beneficial.
Strategy Optimizer Agent (v3 - Advanced): Explore fully automated logic modification loops (highly experimental) or integration with Genetic Programming techniques.
Advanced Risk Management: Implement VaR/CVaR calculations, portfolio correlation analysis, dynamic capital allocation across strategies.
UI/UX: Add advanced analytics dashboards, custom reporting, potentially mobile notifications/controls.
Robustness & Security: Conduct thorough testing, enhance fail-safes, perform security reviews.
Further Expansion: Add more brokers, asset classes (commodities, global equities), or other features based on strategic direction.
Outcome: A mature, robust, high-performance trading system continuously improved and adapted based on performance and evolving requirements.
This roadmap provides a structured approach. Remember that the timelines are estimates and can be adjusted. The key is to complete each phase thoroughly before moving to the next. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any priorities within this roadmap!




my plan is different i want to add 15-20 strategy but we wil start with 5-6 as of now, and we will elt all stretegy run in all market situation/condtion and we will not restrict that one will run only in choppy other nots, my goal is to see which strtegy works better in which market condtion, based on market condtion we will rank the stretegies .And then finally after ranking sorting priority and amrket constion basis we will let the agent to decide to pick the stretegy based on condition. how does this sound ?

and as per your suggestion we will pass these stretegy parameter to llm to tune and analyse the backtest result, it will not read all trades but summary, pnl,accuracy,win, exit reason count. ofr eg supertrend, it can tweak the param and run by own to see the out come then. save teh pram confirg based on market condition. simialr ly setting tp,sl,tsl also through a iterative process unless optimum result didnot come for all stretegies, now it not jsut rank based on market condiotn, it wil lsave pram values based on market constion too and pick based on their performance. later we can educe the stretegy ppol if someone not performing well.


We need to split the session in to 3, specially in indian market 9.15-3.30. and capture day too. So the table will capture info like - " Market Condition | Session | Day | Strategy | Param | Isecpirty Day | win % | Perfomance Score | (if option expiry day or not ) | Time Frame | and other ifno if any needed etc. We can use optun tool+llm
